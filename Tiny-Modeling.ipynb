    "We are modeling and designing a passive solar home module which will be placed in a vehicle base. Its purpose is to provide a portable 3rd community space for discussions, relaxations, and events. It's a mobile living room for anyone and everyone! To this end, the focus will be on designing and modeling a home which is suitable for multiple temperatures common to Boston. Additionally, we will select materials which optimize for low weight and which are feasible for placement inside of a vehicle."
